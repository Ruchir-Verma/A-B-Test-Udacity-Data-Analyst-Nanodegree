A reference to the A/B Test project that was there in Udacity's Data Analyst NanoDegree.



What Is A/B Testing?
A/B testing (also known as split testing or bucket testing) is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better. AB testing is essentially an experiment where two or more variants of a page are shown to users at random, and statistical analysis is used to determine which variation performs better for a given conversion goal.


I have uploaded the datasets used in this project.
